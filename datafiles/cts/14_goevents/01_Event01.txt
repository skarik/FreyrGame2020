	1 On my planet attacking the disabled is a crime you scaly bastard!


}

lines
{
	target go

	1 Guess you’re gonna have to arrest me and then yourself.
	2 We both are missing a few parts. 

}


lines
{

	target player 
	object 0
	1 That sounds like a lot of work.
	2 To much in fact. 

}


lines
{
	target go
	object 1
	1 You’re right, it does. So what’s your solution, then?
	2 A punishment of some kind?

}


lines
{

	target player 
	object 0
	1 Punishment? Oh, you’re that type, huh?


}


lines
{
	target go
	object 1
	1 I hardly $wknow what you mean$$. I just think that you’re stalling.

	1 Oh, darn, caught gold handed. 


}


lines
{

	target libby
	1 He smirks at you. His brow furrowing playfully. 
	2 You can feel his tail snake around your leg and for a moment you think he’s going to toss you off.

}

lines
{

	target player 
	object 0
	1 That tail of yours is a real problem.
	2 Would hate for you to have to lose it. 

}


lines
{
	target go
	object 1
	1 I just use the gifts the Goddess gave me.


}


lines

	target player 
	object 0
	1 Oh and what other $wgifts$$ do you have?  

}


lines
{
	target go
	object 1
	1 Well. I can name several that would be useful in this situation. 

}


lines
{

	target player 
	object 0
	1 Try me, scales. 
}

lines
{

	target libby
	1 He leans up on his elbows as you look at each other. Despite all the flirting it seems your both aren’t sure how to proceed.
	2 You wanted to kiss him, but you weren't really sure if the feeling was mutual. 

}


lines
{
	target go
	object 1
	1 I'm usually pretty plastered by the time I get to this point.

}


lines
{

	target player 
	object 0
	1 Same.

lines
{

	1 Taloned tipped fingers reach out to push a misbehaving hair off your forehead.

}


lines
{

	target player 
	object 0
	1 If you’re going to ask me if you can kiss me you really don’t have to ask. 

}

lines
{

	target libby
	1 You blurt these words woud before you can give them any real thought. 

}

lines
{
	target go
	object 1
	1 Who said I wanted to?


}


lines
{

	target libby
	1 You both snort as you turn your heads to laugh. You find yourself cradled in the man’s lap as he sits up ; water up to your waists.

	1 So about these Goddess given gifts of yours.... 

}

lines
{

	target libby
	1 Your arms find purchase on his shoulders. Fingers trace the scales on the back of his neck with curiosity.
	2 They are quite smooth and appear to reflect the moonlight.

}


lines

	object 1
	1 Sure about this? I’m only half human.
	2 People might talk.

}

lines

	2 I must know more.


}

lines
{

	target player

	1 You’ve got pillows in that tent over there? Sounds fancy. Love to see ‘em.


}

lines
{

	target libby
	1 He chuckles at you. You can tell he’s about to say something stupid. So you kiss him before he can. 
	2 His talons scrap at your waist as you paw at each other. 
	3 The situation seemes like its going to get a lot more interesting but-

lines

	1 Dammit.
}


lines
{

	target player 
	object 0
	1 Hm? What’s wrong? 
	2 Is there where you tell me you're married? 

}

lines
{
	target go
	object 1
	1 What? No. It’s just uh…
}

lines
{

	target libby
	1 He lifts you off him and pulls you both up to stand.


}

lines
{

	target player 
	object 0
	1 Please tell me it’s cause you have to piss because I've been holding it for well over ten minutes.

}

lines
{
	target go
	object 1
	1 Oh, thank Goddess. You too? 
}


lines
{

	target player 
	object 0
	1 That alcohol does not stay put does it?
	2 Never had this happen before. 

}

lines
{
	target go
	object 1
	1 I sort of forgot, was a little to preoccupied trying to keep you from breaking into the church.

}


lines
{

	target player 
	object 0
	1 I just wanted to scribble a dong on the Vicar's face! 
	2 Listen you just go to that corner and I'll go over here. 

}


lines
{
	target go
	object 1
	1 Like I said he doesn't live in the church.
	2 This kind of ruins the mood doesn't it? 

}


lines
{

	target libby
	1 You’re practically yelling across the oasis at each other, the awkwardness of the situation lost on both of you all the sudden. 

}

lines
{

	target player 
	object 0
	1 I could name a worse bodily function that puts a real downer on the $wmood$$.

}

lines
{
	target go
	object 1
	1 Goddess I remember those da-

}

lines
{

	target libby
	1 He cuts himself off. It seems like he was about to say something pretty personal. 

}


lines
{

	target player 
	object 0
	1 Don’t like talking about yourself much do you?

}


lines
{
	target go
	object 1
	1 Could say the same for you.
	2 You talk a lot, but don't really say anything. 

}


lines
{

	target libby
	1 You both meet in the middle again, washing your hands in the water side by side.
	2 Before standing with your arms crossed looking each other over. His tail swishes behind him like a riled up cat.

}


lines
{

	target player 
	object 0
	1 Well I won’t judge yah for nothing. Can’t be anything you’ve done that’s worse than me. 

}



lines
{
	target go
	object 1
	1 Hm. Well. Maybe I’ll talk about it sometime, but for now…


}



lines
{

	target player 
	object 0
	1 Got any card games in that tent of yours?


}


lines
{
	target go
	object 1
	1 Sure do.


}


lines
{

	target player 
	object 0
	1 Then how about a few rounds? See if it sparks the mood again.

}


lines
{
	target go
	object 1
	1 I would be crazy to say no to that. 

}
