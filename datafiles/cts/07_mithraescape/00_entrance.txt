	1c Yeah, yeah. I get it. Name's [PLAYER] and I came here from - that little shabby tent town.
	2c That old man had me bring him here. You can ask him yourself. He mentioned a bar.
	
	1a Alright, don't get your habit in a twist. Name's [PLAYER_NICKNAME]. 
	2a Came from that rundown camp in the desert, helping that old man that was allowed past.
	
	1p Ah! Yes ma'am! My name is [PLAYER]. I came from the desert.
	2p I came to escort the old man that just entered the city.

	2a Stood no chance against my left and right hook - and my stealth.
	
	1p I didnâ€™t really need anything to get by!
