Hello!

Welcome to E.H.S's V-Slice of Freyr!

THIS IS NOT A DEMO.

This build is meant for pitch purposes and limited streaming! There is a lot to pick through in it.
Some of the game may run better then other parts. It might break and there might be a couple loose bolts.
This build is meant to showcase of what we're capable of, along with what direction the game is headed toward.
As such, some of the things you see in this build might not be in the game later or will have changed a great deal.

Common Annoyances:
- The crop box in the farm has odd controls, and terrible returns. Every other day, a vendor comes to Oasis - trade with him instead.
- When doing the "Events" from the main menu, save games will not immediately work. Try to save at an Iconolith as soon as possible, else when you die the game enters a bugged state.

Thank you for coming!
